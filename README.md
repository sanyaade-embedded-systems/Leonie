What is it
----------

Leonie is a bytecode interpreter for a HyperTalk-like programming language named Hammer. It is written in plain C for portability and control.


How to build
------------

There is currently only an Xcode project for MacOS X test app in the macosx subfolder, however that code should be easily portable to command-line Unix with a few changes.


Better test application
-----------------------

If you want to play around with Leonie in the context of actual bytecode, a good idea would be to check out the Forge and ForgeDebugger projects, which include a command line tool that compiles Hammer source code into Leonie bytecode and runs it.


License
-------

I'm still thinking about a license to open source this under. I've previously released code under a zlib license, but I'm not sure I want to be that liberal with Leonie.

Right now, consider all of this copyrighted and non-distributable until I've made a decision.

I'm open to well-reasoned suggestions, though.
